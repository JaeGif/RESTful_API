RESTful Routing

/posts/:postid/comments/:commentid/:userid      ENDPOINT

list of all posts -> post by ID -> list of all comments on that post -> comment by ID -> author of that comment

/users/:userid/userposts/same-routing-as-above      ENDPOINT

list of all users -> user by ID -> all posts by that user -> post by ID -> ...

/users/:userid/comments/comment:ID     ENDPOINT

routes for all comments by a specific user.

You can filter each query by any params in your DB.
Example to get all comments by a user, can filter comments for user

so 
comments/:commentid
comments?queriesforcommentsonlybyuser would work.
